[Program 2]
[Description]
There are 6 java files: CovertChannel.java contains the main class. SecureSystem.java and SecurityLevel.java retains the same functionality from assignment 1. ReferenceMonitor, ObjectManager, and InstructionObject are updated to be able to perform CREATE, DESTROY, and RUN operations.  

To compile this program, use "javac CovertChannel.java" and to run it, use "java CovertChannel inputfilename" to create inputfilename.out or "java CovertChannel v inputfile name" to create a log file of lyle and hal's instructions needed for the covert channel.

[Finish]
The assignment should be finished as it will output inputname.out when given the command without verbose option and output a log if the verbose option is set. We didn't implement the bonus.
